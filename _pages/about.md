I am a PhD student in University of Pennsylvania and a member of the [Implementation of Computation Group](http://ic.ese.upenn.edu/), advised by [Prof. Andre DeHon](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~andre/). Since August 2018, I am on a 3-year leave of absence, fulfilling South Korean military service duty.

I worked as a research engineer at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology(KAIST), Daejeon, in 2018 and 2019. Since this summer, I've been working at AnaPass, Seoul, as a SoC verification engineer.

In the early years of my graduate studies, I worked on accelerating FPGA compilation by running compilation processes in parallel on cloud.Â My research interest includes acceleration on reconfigurable fabric and design-space-exploration on heterogeneous systems(e.g. Xilinx Zynq).
