I am a PhD candidate in University of Pennsylvania and a member of the [Implementation of Computation Group](http://ic.ese.upenn.edu/), advised by [Prof. Andre DeHon](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~andre/).

In the early years of my graduate studies, I worked on accelerating FPGA compilation by running compilation processes in parallel on cloud.Â My research interest includes acceleration on reconfigurable fabric and design-space-exploration on heterogeneous systems(e.g. Xilinx Zynq).
