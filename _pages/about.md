I am a 5th year PhD student in University of Pennsylvania and a member of the [Implementation of Computation Group](http://ic.ese.upenn.edu/), advised by [Prof. Andre DeHon](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~andre/). I received a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. I took 3 years of leave of absence to serve mandatory military service. During the service, I worked as a research engineer at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). I also worked as a SoC engineer at AnaPass, South Korea.

My research interests include Reconfigurable Computing, Partial Reconfiguration, and Network-on-Chip.\

I go by *DJ*, an acronym for the full name *DongJoon*.
