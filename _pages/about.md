I am a PhD candidate in University of Pennsylvania and a member of the [Implementation of Computation Group](http://ic.ese.upenn.edu/), advised by [Prof. Andre DeHon](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~andre/). I received B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.

My research interest includes Reconfigurable Computing, Partial Reconfiguration, and Network-on-Chip.
