I am a final year PhD student in University of Pennsylvania and a member of the [Implementation of Computation Group](http://ic.ese.upenn.edu/), advised by [Prof. Andre DeHon](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~andre/). I received a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.

I go by *DJ*, an abbreviation for the full name *DongJoon*.
