I am an MTS SDE at AMD's FPGA Architecture team. I work on 
a variety of applications for next-generation FPGA devices.
My Ph.D. research focuses on improving FPGA design productivity, creating a development experience for FPGAs
that aligns closely with widely accepted software design principles. 

I go by *DJ*, an abbreviation for the full name *DongJoon*.
