This post illustrates what I've learned trying to get 
Partial Reconfiguration(PR) working in PYNQ system.
This is a summary of the [question](https://discuss.pynq.io/t/partial-reconfiguration-pynq-v2-7/3564)
I posted in PYNQ forum.

## What I've found...
- PYNQ requires .hwh file for both full bitstream and partial bitstreams. .hwh files are 
generated when doing ***generate output products*** in Vivado's block diagram.
  - As I discussed in the previous post, I am forced to use Vivado block diagram to utilize
PR in PYNQ.
- In Vivado's block diagram, I can't set a certain IP directly as a Partition Definition
as explained in [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgjPbaguWCg&t=355s&ab_channel=YunQu).
  - I need a hierarchical block for the IP to set it as Partition Definition like below.

<p style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; text-align:center; color:grey">
vadd IP is in hierarchical block(vmodule). PR in the middle shows that it's Partition Definition 
</p>

- The problem is that as described in my previous [PYNQ tutorial](https://dj-park.github.io/posts/2021/12/PYNQ_TUTORIAL/),
we use ***register_map*** to pass input data to PL. But if you look at the generated .hwh file for vadd IP,
there's no ***REGISTERS*** field. When vadd IP is directly connected without Partition Definition,
it has ***REGISTERS*** in .hwh file as shown below.

<p style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; text-align:center; color:grey">
REGISTERS in .hwh file when vadd is directly connected with other IPs
</p>

- When we do `overlay = Overlay("design_1_wrapper.bit")` in Jupyter Notebook, the PYNQ parser parses
`design_1_wrapper.hwh` file and creates ip dictionary that contains all infomation on HW design.
Because PYNQ is dependent on .hwh file, if it lacks info regarding registers, we can't use ***register_map***.
You can take a look at [source code](https://pynq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/pynq/overlay.html#DefaultHierarchy)
to check what happens underneath.


## Solutions
- The first resolution, as suggested in [my question](https://discuss.pynq.io/t/partial-reconfiguration-pynq-v2-7/3564)
in PYNQ forum, is that we can extract ***REGISTERS*** data for vadd IP and write our own Python driver.
What's done by parser can be manually done by the user. I don't know how Vivado generates .hwh file, but
I've found that `component.xml` file(that's generated if I export IP from Vitis IP) seems to contain related data.
- The second resolution would be modifying .hwh file so that it properly contains ***REGISTERS***. But this
approach requires you to fully understand what .hwh file looks like.
