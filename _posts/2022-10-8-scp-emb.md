When scp `.xclbin` files from the host machine to the embedded platform or
scp results back to the host machine,
we don't want to type in id/password every time.

When first boot the embedded platform(ZCU102 for example), at ZCU102, `vi ~/.profile`,
~~~bash
ifconfig eth0 10.10.7.1 netmask 255.0.0.0
~~~
When ZCU102 boots, it will automatically set its ip as 
10.10.7.1(an example addr).

### From workstation to ZCU102(for example)
Set a neighboring ip for the workstation like 10.10.7.2.
Then, at workstation, generate `~/.ssh/id_rsa_zcu102` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa_zcu102.pub`
In `~/.ssh/config`,
~~~bash
Host zcu102
    HostName 10.10.7.1
    User root
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_zcu102
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
~~~

Then, in ZCU102,
`mkdir .ssh` and `vi ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, add `id_rsa_zcu102.pub`.
Finally, at workstation, try `ssh zcu102` to login without typing id/password.


### From ZCU102 to workstation
At ZCU102, `cd ~/.ssh`,
~~~bash
dropbearkey -f id_rsa -t rsa
~~~
to generate `id_rsa`.
Public key is shown in terminal. Copy public key to workstation's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
Try `ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa USER_NAME@10.10.7.2`.
